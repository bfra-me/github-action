# Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript

Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action. :rocket:

This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction. See the [Hello World JavaScript Action](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action)

## Create an action from this template

Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action

## Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript and package it for distribution:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try {
      ...
  }
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will check in the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
npm run build
git add dist
git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/bfra-me/github-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
